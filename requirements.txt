06.03.01 - Hash Table
Implement a HashTable.java file that allows a user to store and retrieve items using a key value pair. The keys should be hash values of the values which will be objects.
Requirements - 
– Your table must operate in roughly O(1) for insert, delete and search operations.
– You may choose the collision handling system that appeals to you (your options are linear, quadratic, buckets, etc.)
- You must initialize your table as an array (what you store in the array is up to you) meaning you’ll need to decide on the size of your array. We can use this to see how many collisions we get. There’s no specific requirement for what size you choose, but your code should work if we decide to change the size later.
- You should use the hashCode function already present in the String class. Note that this function can return negative values and may be larger than the size of your table so you should use the absolute value and also modulo the result by your table size.
String key = "hello"; 
int hashCode = key.hashCode();
int arrayIndex = Math.abs(hashCode) % tableSize;
– I’ve implemented a save and load function into your starter code that allows you to save and load your table into a file so you can store it for later (pretty useful if you want to actually use this as an application). I would recommend you take a look at that code briefly to see what’s going on there.

–My code relies on an Iterator called keys. An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop over data structures. It is an interface that requires the following be implemented:

default void
forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super E> action)
Performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception.
boolean
hasNext()
Returns true if the iteration has more elements.
E
next()
Returns the next element in the iteration.
default void
remove()
Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by this iterator (optional operation).


You will have to implement all of these although you may simply have “forEachRemaining” and “remove” throw an error if they are called since we won’t have a use for them in this project.

What is actually scored:
– You’ve implemented your table as an ARRAY not an ArrayList or something else that takes up more space and requires more than O(1) to access/search.
- public void put(String key, Object value) puts an item into the hashtable. If there are two items with exactly the same key the old one should be replaced with the new one.
- public String get(String key) find an element with the specified key in the table and return it’s value 
- public String remove(String key) remove the element with the specified key, if none exist return null, otherwise return the value removed.
– public Iterator keys() This iterator should be able to retrieve the next key in your hashtable. Note that specifically this part of your program is not going to be O(1) while the above should be relatively close to it. That means you SHOULD NOT use the iterator inside the above methods, it should only be used for the save and load functions already provided as well as the print function described below.
- public void print() - use the iterator to iterate through the hashTable and System.out.println all the key value pairs. Each key value pair should go on it’s own line.





Rubric:



Excellent (3)
Average (2)
Needs work (1)
Missing (0)
Insertion 
Inserting into the HashTable works properly and the operation is always O(1) unless there are collisions. 
Inserting into the HashTable is successful, but may require more than O(1) time to do so. 
Insertion only works some of the time.
-
Deletion
Deleting from the HashTable works and is always O(1) except when collisions require some searching. 
Deleting from the HashTable works always but may not be O(1). 
Deletion only works some of the time.


Retrieval
Retrieving from the HashTable works and is always O(1) except when collisions require some searching. 
Retrieving from  the HashTable works always but may not be O(1). 
Retrieving only works some of the time.
-
Iterator
The iterator correctly implements the next() and hasNext() methods
The iterator does not always correctly return the next() or hasNext() values.
The iterator is only partially implemented
-
Print
The print function correctly prints out all the elements in the hashTable (They need not be in any particular order)
The print function correctly prints some of the elements in the hashTable, but I struggle with collision.
The print function is only partially implemented. 
-
Syntax, comments and conventions
The code is logical and easy to read. All indentations are propper, variables are named appropriately and comments are present explaining the purpose of every function. 
The code is easy to read, but may have some aspects that make it confusing. Most indentations are propper, variables are named appropriately and some comments are present explaining the purpose of every function. 
The code is difficult to read or understand. Documentation may be lacking
